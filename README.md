# hello-world
My first repository.
Hello everyone,

I am a beginner here at GitHub - trying to learn how the site works. I love Geographic Information System (GIS) and programing languages. My current favorite language is Python (the one I know the most about). Now, I'm very interested in Julia, C# and attempting to learn JavaScript.
